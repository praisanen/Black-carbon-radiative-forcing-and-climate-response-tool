# Black-carbon-radiative-forcing-and-climate-response-tool
This repository provides a fortran-based tool which computes an estimate for the radiative forcings and associated global-mean temperature response,
based on the region and annual or monthly BC emission rates given by the user.

This tool is based on the research reported in manuscript

Räisänen, P., Merikanto, J., Makkonen, R., Savolahti, M., Kirkevåg, A., Sand, M., Seland, Ø., and Partanen, A.-I.: Mapping the dependence of BC 
radiative forcing on emission region and season, submitted to Atmos. Chem. Phys., 2022.
